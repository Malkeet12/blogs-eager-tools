Read our dynamic routing \ndocumentation [https://ghost.org/docs/api/handlebars-themes/routing/] for\nfurther details.\nNext: Apps & Integrations\nWork with all your favourite apps and tools using our integrations\n[/apps-integrations/], or create your own custom integrations with webhooks.","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/organising-your-content.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2019-11-24 09:12:43","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-11-24 09:12:43","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2019-11-24 09:12:45","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called tags and the ability to create custom site structures using dynamic routes.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5dda79cc036f0851631c3350","uuid":"d875b652-7683-457c-ae51-94b2b3bdec2a","title":"Managing admin settings","slug":"admin-settings-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/private.png\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/pricing/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"/organising-content/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Make your site private\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"If you've got a publication that you don't want the world to see yet because it's not ready to launch, you can hide your Ghost site behind a basic shared pass-phrase.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"You can toggle this preference on at the bottom of Ghost's General Settings:\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share with anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it.

While this\nsetting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off\nto help keep your site under the radar.\n\nDo remember though, this is not secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on\nthis feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared\npass-phrase for some very basic privacy.\n\nInvite your team \nGhost has a number of different user roles for your team:\n\nContributors\nThis is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own\ndraft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts.\nContributors are untrusted users with the most basic access to your publication.\n\nAuthors\nAuthors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish\ntheir own posts. Authors are trusted users. If you don't trust users to be\nallowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.\n\nEditors\nEditors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an\nAuthor can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well\nas their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors & Authors to the site.\n\nAdministrators\nThe top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do\neverything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site\nsettings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full\naccess to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.\n\nThe Owner\nThere is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which\nhas all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The\nOwner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access\nto additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if\nusing Ghost(Pro) [https://ghost.org/pricing/].\n\n> It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles,\nincluding bio and social links.

Below this, you can set your post URL, publish date and add a custom\nexcerpt.\n\nTags & authors\nYou can easily add multiple tags and authors to any post to filter and organise\nthe relationships between your content in Ghost.\n\nStructured data & SEO\nThere's no need to hard code your meta data. In fact, Ghost will generate\ndefault meta data automatically using the content in your post.\n\nAlternatively, you can override this by adding a custom meta title and\ndescription, as well as unique information for social media sharing cards on\nFacebook and Twitter.\n\nIt's also possible to set custom canonicals, which is useful for guest posts or\ncurated lists of external links.\n\nGhost will automatically implement structured data for your publication using\nJSON-LD to further optimise your content.\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"Article\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Publishing options\",\n        \"logo\": \"https://static.ghost.org/ghost-logo.svg\"\n    },\n    \"author\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"name\": \"Ghost\",\n        \"url\": \"http://demo.ghost.io/author/ghost/\",\n        \"sameAs\": []\n    },\n    \"headline\": \"Publishing options\",\n    \"url\": \"http://demo.ghost.io/publishing-options\",\n    \"datePublished\": \"2018-08-08T11:44:00.000Z\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2018-08-09T12:06:21.000Z\",\n    \"keywords\": \"Getting Started\",\n    \"description\": \"The Ghost editor has everything you need to fully optimise your content. This is where you can add tags and authors, feature a post, or turn a post into a page.\",\n    }\n}\n    \n\nYou can test that the structured data schema [https://schema.org/] on your site\nis working as it should using Google’s structured data tool\n[https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool]. \n\nCode injection\nThis tool allows you to inject code on a per post or page basis, or across your\nentire site. This means you can modify CSS, add unique tracking codes, or add\nother scripts to the head or foot of your publication without making edits to\nyour theme files. \n\nTo add code site-wide, use the code injection tool in the main admin menu. This\nis useful for adding a Google Analytics tracking code, or to start tracking with\nany other analytics tool.\n\nTo add code to a post or page, use the code injection tool within the post\nsettings menu. This is useful if you want to add art direction, scripts or\nstyles that are only applicable to one post or page.\n\nNext: Admin settings\nNow you understand how to create and optimise content, let's explore some admin\nsettings [/admin-settings/] so you can invite your team and start collaborating.","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/publishing-options.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2019-11-24 09:12:43","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-11-24 09:12:43","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2019-11-24 09:12:47","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"The Ghost editor post settings menu has everything you need to fully optimise and distribute your content effectively.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5dda7cfd036f0851631c3392","uuid":"65e7a084-3ee8-43ca-8740-c1873500c13a","title":"Writing posts with Ghost ✍️","slug":"the-editor-4","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/formatting-editor-demo.gif\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"<header class=\\\"site-header outer\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"inner\\\">\\n        {{> \\\"site-nav\\\"}}\\n    </div>\\n</header>\"}],[\"bookmark\",{\"type\":\"bookmark\",\"url\":\"https://ghost.org/\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://ghost.org\",\"title\":\"Ghost: The #1 open source headless Node.js CMS\",\"description\":\"The world’s most popular modern open source publishing platform.

Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and\ntemplates. \n\nYou may not want content tagged with News to exist on: example.com/tag/news.\nInstead, you want it to exist on example.com/news .\n\nIn this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of\ncontent on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme\nto render each content type differently.\n\nThere are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few\ncommon examples: \n\n * Setting a custom home page with its own template\n * Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently,\n   and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content\n * Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by\n   specific authors\n * Including dates in permalinks for your posts\n * Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like \n   example.com/europe/story-title/\n   \n\n> Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using YAML\n[http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html] files.
